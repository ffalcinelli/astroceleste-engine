//! - [`Spk`] reads a JPL SPK kernel (segment types 2 and 3) from a file ([`Spk::open`]) or
//!   from memory ([`Spk::from_bytes`]), and can write an excerpt of it ([`Spk::excerpt`]).
//! - [`Kernel`] names a loaded kernel and computes the span that all its segments cover.
//! - [`KernelSet`] holds kernels in preference order: the first one covering a date is
//!   used, and a date that none covers is an error.
